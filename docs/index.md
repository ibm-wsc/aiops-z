## Labs
It is recommended that you complete the Instana lab first then move on to the Turbonomic and/or IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps labs.

Each lab can be completed independently from one another, but some context will be lost if you do not complete the Instana lab first.

!!! Note "A word about the labs"

    There are often minor changes to the appearance of the user interface for the products used in the labs- e.g., changes in an icon's appearance or color, or minor changes in text on a button, etc.  As a result, some screen snippets shown in the labs may differ slightly from what you encounter during the labs.  These differences should not affect the functionality of the labs, but please don't hesitate to ask for an instructor's help if any confusion arises due to the difference between the lab instructions and your lab experience.
